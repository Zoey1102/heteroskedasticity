## Heteroskedasticity
The heteroskedasticity problem would be in presence when variances of error terms are not constant.
This would increase the variance of coefficient estimate, reducing the liability of our estimate.

---
## Endogenous variable
Regressors correlated with the error term are endogenous, and will caused heteroskedasticity.

---
## Example: Y = beta0 + beta1*X + u, u ~ N(0, f(x))
- f(x) = x^2  
- f(x) = sqrt(x) 
- f(x) = exp(x)  
- f(x) = x^(-1)

## Simulation illustration
See how the error term variance changes when specified different functional form and number of observations:
